      Designing User Interfaces and Systems Analysis and Design I
    </h2>

    <p>
      In these courses, basic concepts of user interface and system design were taught.
      I learned the process of creating user interfaces 
      which includes the use of user stories, personas and scenarios. 
      The professor has given lessons on diagrams such as use case diagrams
      to visually and clearly show the objectives of a software system design.
      I have also learned how to make wire-frames and prototypes for software systems
      which I found very interesting.
