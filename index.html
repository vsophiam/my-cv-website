        <h2>Hey! I'm Maxine &#x1F44B; </h2>
        <h3>Information Technology Major</h3>
        <p>
            I am a fourth year Information Technology Major at York University. 
            I am passionate about developing innovating products and 
            making them into reality.
            I am interested in researching user experience to further improve the 
            objectives and design of a product or system design.
            In my free time I like to spend time with my family and friends, watching movies, 
            or just simply hanging out.
            I also love to travel with my family and take pictures to capture memories 
            and eat food from different cultures.
            My hobbies are learning to play instruments such as guitar and piano.
            I also love to play sports and stay active, such as playing basketball and going 
            mountain biking.
            I love to learn many new things to grow as an individual.
        </p>
